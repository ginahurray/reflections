1)What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

git started to track the file changes. For version controls!

2)How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?

staging area decides what in current directory should be updates in the next
commit. repository keeps track of the commits.
