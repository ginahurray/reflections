1)What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

git started to track the file changes. For version controls!

2)How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?

staging area decides what in current directory should be updates in the next
commit. repository keeps track of the commits.

3)How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

Use git diff --staged

4)What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your
history organized? How would branches help?

Branches can be used to test new features while leaving the original working
version intact. If the new features work, one could combine that at a later
stage.

5)How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

Helps a lot! You can view the relationship between different branches. Makes the
life a lot easier!

git log --graph -oneline master branch1 branch2

6)What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?

After the merge, the overall modification from multiple files is recorded.
Because the two branches become one.
